# Computer Graphics Project

## Introduction

This is a full 3D computer graphics project. Using lwjgl.

## Run

I have tested on my computer(macOS) with GL version "OpenGL version is 2.1 ATI-4.6.20" and Windows10 computer with GL version 4.6

Both of these two version can run this project perfectly.

To start the program, run Main.java

## Performance

I have tested this program on RTX 3060 it can run at 60 fps with VSync on.

But in the video, I am using a Mac computer so the FPS might not very high...

## Control

WASD to move.
Space to jump.
F to change the perspective.

That's it.

## Video

The video has been accelerated to meet the requirement of 3 minutes.... So I suggest you run this project on your computer to see the scence and anmiations....
